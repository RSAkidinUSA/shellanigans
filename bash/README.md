# bash
This directory contains various shell scripts to make your life easier

Makefile:
	Use "make install-(script)" to install a specific script
	Use "make install" to install all scripts
	Check the script section in this readme to see more about the script

mixup.sh
	Oh no. You've gone and confused bash. It doesn't know who you are!
	Use make install-mixup to install the command iamwho to your /usr/bin directory.
	After using iamwho, you can just exit if you confuse yourself too much.

	*TODO*
	Add classier version that reads the script name (iamwhom)
